abstract="In this paper, we present an OWL-based ontology, the Cloud Computing Ontology (CoCoOn), that defines concepts, features, attributes and relations to describe Cloud infrastructure services. We also present datasets that are built using CoCoOn and scripts (i.e. SPARQL template queries and web applications) that demonstrate the real-world applicability of the ontology. We also describe the design of the ontology and the architecture of related services developed with it.",

abstract = {The Cloud infrastructure services landscape advances steadily leaving users in the agony of choice. As a result, Cloud service identication and discovery remains a hard problem due to dierent service descriptions, non- standardised naming conventions and heterogeneous types and features of Cloud services. In this paper, analysis the research challenges and present a Web Ontology Language (OWL) based ontology, the Cloud Computing Ontology (CoCoOn). It denes functional and non-functional concepts, attributes and relations of infrastructure services. We also present a system, CloudRecommender, that implements our domain ontology in a relational model. The system uses regular expressions and Structured Query Language (SQL) for matching user requests to service descriptions. We brie y describe the architecture of the CloudRecommender system, and demonstrate its eectiveness and scalability through a service conguration selection experiment based on a set of prominent Cloud providers' descriptions including Amazon, Azure, and GoGrid.},
